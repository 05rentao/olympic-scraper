How to run:
    1. Requirements: Java 17+ and Maven installed
    2. Run command: `mvn compile exec:java` from project root

Problems:
    The main difficulty was getting around the syntax for regex, for example, having
    to figure out how to add quotes by using /" , and white spaces using //w*

Overview of project:
    I created the Parser class that handles gathering the groups, and implemented
    functions that answers each question, in my ParserTester class, is where I create a
    Parser object using the wiki url and call respective functions to answer each question.

Question 1: List all past and present Olympic sports that start with the letter C?
        [Canoeing, Cricket, Cycling]
    The algorithm I used to find the answer to this question is using the basic
    features of Pattern and Matcher class. Using the expression
        <td><a\\b[^>]*title=\"(" + s + "\\w*) at the Summer Olympics\"[^>]*
    I looked at the HTML file for the wiki page and found the pattern of how they
    structured the sports section with the table, they typically started with
        <td ... ><a...
    and the name of the sport happened right after the next >
    the sport can be multiple words, but followed by </a></td>
    I used a lot of [^>]* type expressions to stop before the next >.

    To make sure that it is the letter I imputed, I simply used string concatination
    to add the parameter "s" to the expression.

Q2: List all countries (full name, not country code) that have participated in the Olympics, but are
now considered “obsolete”?

    [Australasia, Republic of China, Bohemia, Czechoslovakia, Saar, United Team of Germany,
    East Germany, West Germany, Malaya, North Borneo, Netherlands Antilles, Russian Empire,
    Soviet Union, Unified Team, ROC, Individual Neutral Athletes, Yugoslavia,
    Independent Olympic Participants, Serbia and Montenegro, Czechoslovakia, British West Indies,
    South Yemen, North Yemen]

    I first found the URL to navigate to get to the actual participating countries by the following regex

        <a href=\"([^\"]*)\" title=\"List of participating nations at the Summer Olympic Games\"

    Which captured the format that the link appeared in the original webpage.
    After navigating to the new page, I updated the variable content to generate the next
    matchers with. I looked at the specific way that each obsolete country is formatted,
    and noticed that they are colored with bgcolor="#e0e0e0", therefore, using this pattern, I used the
    following regex to capture the name of the country.

        <td align="left" bgcolor="#e0e0e0".*?title=[^>]*>([^<]+)</a>

    As you can see, I matched to the table data <td>, and then the background color. Then, I used
    .*? to non-greedily skip to the next occurrence of "title=", because i felt that was the next unique
    element in the line I could jump to. After title, I skip to the next occurrence of > by [^>]*
    and extract out anything from there to the next "<"

List all countries that have won at least 6 silver medals in 2016.

    [United States, Great Britain, China, Russia, Germany, Japan, France, Italy,
    Australia, Netherlands, Brazil, Kenya, New Zealand, Denmark, Sweden, South Africa,
    Azerbaijan]

    By the same approach as the previous question, i navigated to the webpage
    called "2016 Summer Olympics medal table" by explicitly pattern matching
    against the phrase "\(year) Summer Olympics medal table ".

    To which i found the pattern of <tr> title= >(country name)<\th></td>
    immediately followed by numbers of medals. however, some countries has
    symbols after the <\a> part, to accomodate this, i had to add .{0,1}
    to include times when there is a symbol and not.

    Next, I encountered a problem where I had to include "Independent Olympic Athletes"
    but it was followed by a super script, and my simple approach of either
    accounting for 1 or 0 letters failed. Additionally, if i simply scanned for
    the next </th>, I would somehow end up with Michael Phelps as a country as
    well. But finding out about the optionally contains expression was helpful
        (?:<sup.*?</sup>)?
    combined with .{0,1} I was able to catch all the cases. And the sum of all
    countries in my scan was finally 86.

    Once I got to that point, all i had to do was to check the number of silver
    medals, which was relatively easy through arraylist's remove().

List all countries that had podium sweeps in 2012.

    [Italy, Jamaica, China]

    In this algorithm podiumSweep(), I noticed that the xxxx summer olympics site had a section
    for podium sweeps, so I created a regex in my alg that specifically looked for the "xxxx
    Summer Olympics" sites. I did that by using the following regex

        <li><a href=\"([^\"]+)\" title=\"" + year + " Summer Olympics\"

    Which extracted the url, and handled the url change in the navigateWiki() function.
    Next, I wanted to extract the information from the Medal Table, Podium sweeps section.
    To do this, I simply looked for where the heading "Podium sweeps" occurred on the site
    and extracted all the information up until the next section header, "Broadcasting," which
    has the size of header 2 or h2. Therefore I used the regex below to extract all the text
    between those 2 sections.

        <h3 id="Podium_sweeps">Podium sweeps</h3>(.*?)h2

    After extracting the section containing the information on medal sweeps, I simply looked
    at the structure of the table and used the following regex to find when the country name
    occurred and extract that out. Which I recognized that each entry must start with <tr> or table
    row, and follow some characters away from title= Similar to the previous regex, we have

        <tr><td.*?<td><span .*?title=[^>]*>([^<]+)</a>

    And I was able to extract out all information.

How many total medals has the United States won in Volleyball?

    [6]

    The algorithm for totalMedalSport() is similar to the previous, the first step is to find the page
    corresponding with each sport. We do this by scanning the starting page, and using the following
    regex to extract out the link.

        <li><a href=\"([^\"]+)\" [^>]*>" + sport + "</a></li>

    Additionally, I also extract out the "medal table" section for ease of regex. At this point,
    I've abstracted the functionality of getting the section and updating the content to which the
    matcher is constructed with is it's own function, getSection(). I use the following regex
    command with this function to extract the medal tables section for any sport page.

        <h[23] id="[^"]+">Medal table</h[23]>(.*?)<h[23]

    Note that i use h[23], this is because depending on the page, the "medal table" can be an h2
    header or an h3 header.
    Next, to find the actual total number of medals the countries have won, we use the following regex
    command.

        <tr><td>\\d+</td><th.*?title=[^>]*>" + country + "</a>(?:.*?</span>)?</th><td>\\d+</td><td>\\d+</td><td>\\d+</td><td>(\\d+)</td></tr>

    Note that we use an optional (?:.*?</span>)? again. This is because depending on the site, structure of
    can be different.

How many governing bodies of the past or present sports from the Summer Olympics are
headquartered in Switzerland?

        14

    The algorithm for summerSportHeadQuarter() begins by locating the Wikipedia page for the
    Association of Summer Olympic International Federations. To extract the URL for this page,
    we use the following regex:

        <a href="([^\"]*)" title=[^>]*>Association of Summer Olympic International Federations</a>

    Once on this nexgt page, I extract only the relevant section of the content containing the member
    federations by using a function i defined called "getSection()" Where I input a some regex that extracts
    a whole section.

        <h2 id=\"[^\"]+\">Members</h2>(.*?)<h2

    Here, it extracts all outputs in in the members section. To which i will extract the website redirects
    and the name of the country with the following regex.

        <tr>\\s*<td><a [^>]+>[^<]*</a></td>\\s*<td><a href=\"([^\"]+)\" title=\"[^\"]+\">([^<]*)</a>

    Then, I add the link, name of the country, into lists. Using a for loop, I update the url and the
    the corresponding content, but i match all the subpages in the arraylist with the following
    regex pattern

        <tr><th [^>]*>Headquarters</th>(?:.*?Country</th>)?<td class=\"infobox[^\"]+\">.*?<a href=[^>]+>([^<]+)</a>(?:, ([^<]+))?<"

    Finally. In this step we get the specific country names, and we find that there to be existing

Among all Summer Olympics hosted in the United States since 1960, how many countries did the
torch relay that covered the longest total distance pass through?

        Year 1984, 2 countries.

    I approached this problem by first considering the wikipage it is on, and navigating to
    the according page. In this case, this is the page titled "List of Olympic torch relays."
    Using regex and my navigateWiki() function, I arrive at the next site.

    My next step is the retrive the section "Summer Olympic Games" specifically from the document
    so that it's easier for me to parse, without having to worry about the winter games. To do that
    I used the regex command

        <h2 id=\"Summer_Olympic_Games\">Summer Olympic Games</h2>(.*?)<h2

    At this point, I noticed that the infomation directly in the graph is not yet helpful, but the
    links it supplies is much more helpful. Therefore, I navigate to these links in the table
    And to do that, I used the following regex espression, since the link typically was after
    the phrase "Main article."

        Main article: <a href="(/wiki/\d{4}_Summer_Olympics_torch_relay)"[^>]*>(\d{4}) Summer Olympics torch relay

    After extracting an ArrayList of strings, I simply iterate through the list, and visit each
    corresponding webpage, and scrape information aboregarding the Relay. And it turns out, there is
    some useful information in the webpage, specifically, it follows right before the "Countries visited,"
    label. However, in making our algorithm more dynamic, we would also need to check that the
    country the game is held at is the country we wanted to look at in the problem, in this case,
    we extract also the country of the host city, and make sure that it is "United States" in this case,
    using the following command.

        Host city</th><td [^>]*>(?:<a href=.*?</a>)*, ([^<]+)</td></tr>.*?Countries visited</th><td class="infobox-data">([^<]+)</td></tr>

    Note that here I've extracted out the entire text consisteing of commas that separate the country
    strings, therefore, we create a new simple expression [^,]+ to separate each country element, so that
    we are able to count the size easier to answer this question. Additionally, I've also incorporated the
    ability to choose the year by using an if statement and simply checking

        Integer.parseInt(years.get(i)) > year

A question that I think is interesting is, "Which country is the unluckiest and is likely to have the most
scandals, controversies and incidents?" I came up with this questio upon looking through the related wiki pages.

    To begin this problem, I navigate to the page using navigateWiki() using the followin regex command

        <a href="([^"]*)" [^>]*>List of Olympic Games scandals and controversies</a></li>

    I then create a treemap that would store the number of counts per country. Where a count is defined as a list
    item, where it represent some scandal, controversy, or incidents. Thus after creating the map and initializing
    values. I got to work with regex that pattern matched to the subheadings "xxxx _____ Olympics – _____, ____."
    In addition to this, I also purposefully extended the pattern from the end of /div> to the next <div. This is
    because the content in between is the unordered list, and my intent here is to count the total number of bullet
    points per country. Therefore, after extracting the substring that contains the unordered list using the below.

        <div class="mw-heading mw-heading3"><h3[^>]*>.*?Olympics.*?, ([^<,]+)</h3>.*?/div>(.*?)<div

    I then took the output from the second group(unordered list) and then pattern matched it again to the pattern <li>
    directly, and counting the total number of times it appears. I did this via a forloop, while using the map to keep
    track of the number of bullet points each hosting has.

        The answer to this question, after returning the whole map, is interestingly, Germany with 10 separate bullet
        points not even counting west Germany. This can potentially be biased due to the frequency in which Germany
        hosts and not neccesarily reflective of the German people.

    {Austria=1, Belgium=3, Brazil=0, Canada=0, China=0, France=4, Germany=10, Greece=8, Italy=2, Japan=5, Netherlands=1, Republic of Korea=4, Russia=0, Soviet Union=4, Sweden=4, Switzerland=2, USA=2, United Kingdom=4, United States=5, West Germany=6, Yugoslavia=0}









For the actual implementation of the interfece the user interacts with. I kind of just came up with
a basic chatbox concept.
